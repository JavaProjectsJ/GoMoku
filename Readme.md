# GOMoku Java Game

## What is GOMoku?

```
GOMoku, also called Five in a Row, is an abstract strategy board game. It is traditionally played 
with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a Go board. It is played using a 19×19 board or 
15×15 board. Because pieces are typically not moved or removed from the board, gomoku may also
be played as a paper-and-pencil game. The game is known in several countries under different names.
